# Hi, I'm Nitin K.

I am a software engineer in New York City with B.S. Computer Science and junior level work experience in **React / NodeJS development**.

My deep love for learning and teaching has me studying hard on **full stack web development**, while hosting a classroom of 9 students on Discord.

I am also studying **data structures and algorithms** to hone my skills.

# About this GitHub

Feel free to take a look through my GitHub, which I treat sort of as a **portfolio**. My pins showcase large projects built with **various Node stacks**, hopefully demonstrating my skill level.
