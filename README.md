# Hi, I'm Nitin K.

I am a Software Engineer at Prudential Financial. Based in New York City, with B.S. Computer Science and work experience in React, micro-frontend architecture, and web framework development.

# About this GitHub

Feel free to take a look through my GitHub, which I treat sort of as a **portfolio**. My pins showcase large projects built with **various Node stacks**, hopefully demonstrating my skill level.

I unfortunately have less time than I used to for personal projects because I'm always learning and making commits at work!
